# S4. API



## 📄 Description

Welcome to the repository for the S4. API project! 

🎬 In this project, we focus on building a web application that consumes data from an external API to display jokes to users before their workday starts. 
The main goals are to learn about API consumption, handle asynchronous calls using async/await, and practice TypeScript while creating a user-friendly, dynamic web application. 🚀


The project involves:

Fetching jokes from an external API.

Displaying them on the webpage.

Collecting feedback on the jokes through a rating system.

Integrating a weather API to show the current weather.

Alternating between different joke sources.




## 💻 Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were used in this project:

HTML/CSS: For creating the structure and styling of the website.

TypeScript: For implementing the functionality.

API consumption (REST): Using fetch and async/await for asynchronous data handling.

Bootstrap: For responsive design and easy layout implementation.

Node.js: To run the project and manage dependencies.

npm: Package manager to run scripts and install dependencies.

Visual Studio Code: Recommended code editor.




## 📋 Requirements

To run this project, you’ll need:

Node.js (version 14 or higher).

npm (usually included with Node.js).

A text editor like Visual Studio Code.




## 🌐 Deployment

To deploy or test changes locally:

Make sure you have the Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code.

Open the index.html file and right-click to select Open with Live Server to view your page in the browser.




## 📂 Repository Contents

Functionality Overview:

Joke Display: Fetches a random joke and displays it on the screen.

Rate the Joke: Allows users to rate jokes with a score system (1-3).

Next Joke Button: Loads a new joke when clicked.

Weather Info: Displays weather information at the start of the page load.




## 📂 Project Structure:

/src: Contains the TypeScript code (e.g., joke fetching, button interactions).

/css: Contains the SCSS and CSS files for styling.

/img: Image files used in the project.

/index.html: Main HTML file containing the structure of the page.

/dist: Contains all compiled JavaScript files generated from the TypeScript code in /src.




## ⚙️ Testing Notes

To test the functionality of your project:

Ensure that you can load a new joke on each button click.

Verify the joke rating works as expected (1-3 scale).

Ensure the weather information is displayed at the start.

Run the project and make sure the layout adjusts correctly across different screen sizes (using media queries).




## 🎬 Fun Notes

Seeing your project come to life with dynamic content like jokes and weather updates is both fun and rewarding! 🟢✨

Keep in mind that consuming data from APIs is an essential skill for any front-end developer, and it will become second nature as you gain more experience.
